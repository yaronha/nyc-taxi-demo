    "# MLOps Tutorial - NYC Taxi fare\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates a complete ML project and the development flow from initial exploration to continuous deployment at scale.\n",
    "The example is based on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction). It uses the public NYC Taxi dataset, and its goal is to predict the correct trip fare.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is intended to explain and demonstrate the overall MLOps flow and uses [MLRun](https://www.mlrun.org/) MLOps orchestration framework. It is not designed to dive into the individual components or model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open inside Sagemaker and follow the Sagemaker installation section in the [README.md](./README.md) file\n",
    "\n",
    "ML application development and productization flow consists of the following steps (demonstrated through notebooks):\n",

    "- [**Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling**](./00-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "- [**Data and model pipeline development**](./01-dataprep-train-test.ipynb) (data preparation, training, evaluation and so on).\n",
    "- [**Application & serving pipeline development**](./02-serving-pipeline.ipynb) (intercept requests, process data, inference and so on).\n",
    "- [**Scaling and automation**](./03-automation-monitoring.ipynb) (run at scale, hyper-parameter tuning, monitoring, pipeline automation and so on).\n",
    "- Continuous operations (automated tests, CI/CD integration, upgrades, retraining, live ops and so on).\n",
